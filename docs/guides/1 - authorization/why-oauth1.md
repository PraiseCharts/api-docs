## Why OAuth 1.0a instead of OAuth 2
We had a legacy version of our API with a substantial number of users connected. We opted to support OAuth 1.0a first because it allowed us to maintain the access tokens for all those users who were already connected.

## Will you support OAuth 2
Yes we plan to add support for OAuth 2 sometime in 2022.

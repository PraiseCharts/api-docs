Introduction

Catalog items have the ability to be individually published without having to rebuild the entire catalog.

We call this feature the Catalog Item Publish Queue

All you need to do is click publish and choose a time to automatically release the Catalog Item at that

time.

Background Info

Catalog Items have 5 availability statuses

1. <Highlight bg="#81c784">Live</Highlight> (Currently Live)
1. <Highlight bg="#fff076">Live Pending</Highlight> (New changes going live) 
1. <Highlight bg="#64b5f6" color="#f44236">Pending</Highlight> (Going live for the first time)
1. <Highlight bg="#e0e0e0">Unpublished</Highlight> (A Draft or newly created Catalog Item)
1. <Highlight bg="#000" color="#fff">My PC Only</Highlight> (Was live but is not for sale anymore)

All Times are displayed in Central Time

Catalog Items must be “Available” and have a Release Date in the Past

Editing a the Sellable Products attached to a Catalog Item will automatically add the Catalog Item to the

be published.
